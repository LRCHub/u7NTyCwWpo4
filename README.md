[00:07.21] Yo!
[00:08.48] Automatic, mind is racing
[00:10.27] Left to right, 365
[00:11.89] Call me obsessed, a witch, I don't mind
[00:13.71] 'Cause my ideas are one of a kind
[00:30.21] 
[00:15.60] Beauty is in the eye of the beholder
[00:17.62] Lines and curves, systems and controllers
[00:19.39] My intelligence proves my excellence
[00:21.26] Next to my machines, you don't stand a chance (chance, chance, chance, chance)
[01:00.26] 
[00:30.32] Can you hear the symphony of gears turning?
[00:32.53] Engines whirring, forging, building
[00:34.35] Wearing, tearing, full of energy
[00:36.30] So many possibilities
[00:46.80] 
[00:37.71] Even machines have real feelings
[00:39.44] Might not believe it, but I can see creativity
[00:41.70] Higher than the tenth degree
[00:42.74] Call me gifted, a prodigy
[00:44.12] Working on my craft like it's my duty (duty, duty, duty, duty)
[01:15.12] 
[01:05.97] Yeah, I made all of it
[01:07.51] From inside out, every little inch
[01:09.63] Yeah, look at all my children
[01:11.22] Piece by piece, I put my heart into it
[01:30.22] 
[01:13.23] Yeah, you can hear its beat
[01:14.91] They have emotions if you face up to it
[01:16.94] Yeah, I created it
[01:18.68] Somehow I feel like I'm a part of it
